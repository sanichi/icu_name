= ICU Name

Canonicalises and matches person names with Western European characters.

Note: version 1.1.0 dropped support for characters beyond codepoint 255 and became independent of activesupport and i18n.

== Installation

Tested with ruby 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 2.0.0 and 2.2.0.

  gem install icu_name

== Names

This class exists for two main purposes:

* to normalise to a common format the different ways Irish person names are typed in practice
* to be able to match two names even if they are not exactly the same in their original form

To create a name object, supply both the first and second names separately to the constructor.

  robert = ICU::Name.new(' robert  j ', ' FISHER ')

Capitalisation, white space and punctuation will all be automatically corrected:

  robert.name                                                 # => 'Robert J. Fischer'
  robert.rname                                                # => 'Fischer, Robert J.'  (reversed name)

The input text, without any changes apart from white-space cleanup and the insertion of a comma
(to separate the two names), is returned by the <tt>original</tt> method:

  robert.original                                             # => 'FISCHER, robert j'

To avoid ambiguity when either the first or second names consist of multiple words, it is better to
supply the two separately. If the full name is supplied alone to the constructor, without any indication
of where the first names end, then the last distinct name is assumed to be the last name.

  bobby = ICU::Name.new(' bobby  fischer ')
  bobby.first                                                 # => 'Bobby'
  bobby.last                                                  # => 'Fischer'

In this case, since the names were not supplied separately, the <tt>original</tt> text will not contain a comma:

  bobby.original                                              # => 'bobby fischer'

Names will match even if one is missing middle initials or if a nickname is used for one of the first names.

  bobby.match('Robert J.', 'Fischer')                         # => true

The method <tt>alternatives</tt> can be used to list alternatives to a given first or last name:

  Name.new('Stephen', 'Orr').alternatives(:first)             # => ["Steve"]
  Name.new('Michael Stephen', 'Orr').alternatives(:first)     # => ["Steve", "Mike", "Mick", "Mikey"],
  Name.new('Oissine', 'Murphy').alternatives(:last)           # => ["Murchadha"],
  Name.new('Mark', 'Orr').alternatives(:first)                # => []
  
By default the class uses a set of first and last name alternatives curated for the ICU.
However, this can be customized (see below).

Supplying the <tt>match</tt> method with strings is equivalent to instantiating an instance with the same
strings and then matching it. So, for example the following are equivalent:

  robert.match('R.', 'Fischer')                               # => true
  robert.match(ICU::Name.new('R.', 'Fischer'))                # => true

Here the inital _R_ matches the first letter of _Robert_. However, nickname matches will not
always work with initials. In the next example, the initial _R_ does not match the first letter
_B_ of the nickname _Bobby_.

  bobby.match('R. J.', 'Fischer')                             # => false

Some other ways last names are canonicalised are illustrated below:

  ICU::Name.new('John', 'O Reilly').last                      # => "O'Reilly, John"
  ICU::Name.new('dave', 'mcmanus').last                       # => "McManus, Dave"

== Characters and Encoding

The class can only cope with Latin characters, including those with diacritics (accents).
Hyphens, single quotes (which represent apostophes) and letters in the ISO-8859-1 range
(e.g. "a", "è", "Ö") are preserved, while everything else is removed (unsupported).

  ICU::Name.new('éric', 'PRIÉ').name                          # => "Éric Prié"
  ICU::Name.new('BARTŁOMIEJ', 'śliwa').name                   # => "Bartomiej Liwa"
  ICU::Name.new('Սմբատ', 'Լպուտյան').name                     # => ""

The various accessors (<tt>first</tt>, <tt>last</tt>, <tt>name</tt>, <tt>rname</tt>, <tt>to_s</tt>, <tt>original</tt>) always return
strings encoded in UTF-8, no matter what the input encoding.

  eric = ICU::Name.new('éric'.encode("ISO-8859-1"), 'PRIÉ'.force_encoding("ASCII-8BIT"))
  eric.rname                                                  # => "Prié, Éric"
  eric.rname.encoding.name                                    # => "UTF-8"
  eric.original                                               # => "PRIÉ, éric"
  eric.original.encoding.name                                 # => "UTF-8"

Accented letters can be transliterated into their US-ASCII counterparts by setting the
<tt>:chars</tt> option, which is available in all accessors. For example:

  eric.rname(:chars => "US-ASCII")                            # => "Prie, Eric"
  eric.original(:chars => "US-ASCII")                         # => "PRIE, eric"

Note that the character encoding of the strings returned is still UTF-8 in all cases.
The same option also relaxes the need for accented characters to match exactly:

  eric.match('Eric', 'Prie')                                  # => false
  eric.match('Eric', 'Prie', :chars => "US-ASCII")            # => true

== Customization of Alternative Names

We saw above how _Bobby_ and _Robert_ were able to match because, by default, the
matcher is aware of some common English nicknames. These name alternatives can be
customised to handle additional nicknames and other types of alternative names
such as common spelling errors and player name changes.

The alternative names consist of two arrays, one for first names and
one for last names. Each array element is itself an array of strings
representing a set of equivalent names. Here, for example, are some
of the default first name alternatives:

  ["Anthony", "Tony"]
  ["James", "Jim", "Jimmy", "Jamie"]
  ["Robert", "Bob", "Bobby"]
  ["Stephen", "Steve", "Steven"]
  ["Thomas", "Tom", "Tommy"]

The first of these means that _Anthony_ and _Tony_ are considered equivalent and can match.

  ICU::Name.new("Tony", "Miles").match("Anthony", "Miles")    # => true

To change alternative name behaviour, you can replace the default alternatives
with a customized set perhaps stored in a database or a YAML file, as illustrated below:

  ICU::Name.reset_alternatives
  data = YAML.load(File open "my_last_name_alternatives.yaml")
  ICU::Name.load_alternatives(:last, data)
  data = YAML.load(File open "my_first_name_alternatives.yaml")
  ICU::Name.load_alternatives(:first, data)

Note that without the call to <tt>reset_alternatives</tt>, the new loaded alternatives
add to, rather than replace, the defaults.

Other uses of alternatives is to cater for English and Irish versions of the same name,
for example (last names):

  [Murphy, Murchadha]

or for variations including spelling variations, for example (first names):

  [Patrick, Pat, Paddy, Padraig, Padraic, Padhraig, Padhraic]

== Conditional Alternatives

Normally, entries in the two arrays are just lists of alternative names. There is one
exception to this however, when one of the entries (it doesn't matter which one but,
by convention, the last one) is a regular expression. Here is an example that might
be added to the last name alternatives:

  ["Quinn", "Benjamin", /^(Debbie|Deborah)$/]

What this means is that the last names _Quinn_ and _Benjamin_ match but only when the
first name matches the given regular expression. In this case it caters for a female
whose last name changed after marriage.

  Name.new("Debbie", "Quinn").match("Debbie", "Benjamin")     # => true
  Name.new("Mark", "Quinn").match("Mark", "Benjamin")         # => false

Another example, this time for first names, is:

  ["Sean", "John", /^Bradley$/]

This caters for an individual who is known by two normally unrelated first names.
The two first names only match when the last name is _Bradley_.

  Name.new("John", "Bradley").match("Sean", "Bradley")        # => true
  Name.new("John", "Alfred").match("Sean", "Alfred")          # => false
